                        <h1>The life and Art of Salvador Dalí</h1>

                            <div class="biography">

                                <h2>Biography</h2>
                                    <p>The man. The master. The marvel. Salvador Dalí is one of the most celebrated artists of all time. His fiercely technical yet highly unusual paintings, sculptures and visionary explorations in film and life-size interactive art ushered in a new generation of imaginative expression. From his personal life to his professional endeavors, he always took great risks and proved how rich the world can be when you dare to embrace pure, boundless creativity.</p>
                                    <p>Born in Figueres on 11 May 1904, as Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, he attended the drawing school on 1916 and, at the age of 13, had his charcoal drawings exhibited in his family home by his father. Three years later, the Municipal Theatre in his hometown hosted his first public exhibition. Dalí then enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, where he also first came into contact with the Surrealist movement. Expelled from the Academy in 1926, right before his final exams under the accusation of having started an unrest, he nevertheless continued his creative endeavors that were to turn him into an enduring figure in the history of art.</p>
                                    <p>In 1931, Dalí painted one of his most famous works, The Persistence of Memory, which developed a surrealistic image of soft, melting pocket watches. The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches are a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic. This idea is supported by other images in the work, such as the wide expanding landscape, and other limp watches shown being devoured by ants</p> 
                                    <p>In 1934 Dali and Gala marry in a civil ceremony on January 30.
                                    In December 1936 Dalí participated in the Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism exhibition at MoMA and a solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York. Both exhibitions attracted large attendances and widespread press coverage. The painting Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War) (1936) attracted particular attention. On 14 December, Dalí, aged 32, was featured on the cover of Time magazine.</p>
                                    <p>Following the German occupation of Paris, the Dali’s fleed to America to live for the next eight years, working with figures like Hitchcock and Disney. They divided their time between New York and California.</p>
                                    <p>Although generally associated with specific works nowadays, Dalí is still impossible to pin down. Creator of hallucinatory dreamscapes, indulging in off-the-wall behavior, he equally inspired and appalled, and was simultaneously revered and despised; however, he unquestionably captured everyone’s attention. He was banished from the artistic group to the recognition of which he significantly contributed, but also appeared on the cover of Time magazine, was the madman in one of the sequences of Hitchcock’s film Spellbound, and ultimately made an undisputable impact on the 20th century art.</p>
